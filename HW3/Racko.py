'''This is a fun program I wrote in Python in Spring 2015 for a Penn Engineering Course.
Rack-O is a popular family card game invented in the 50s, where the goal is to arrange
ten cards from your hand in order, pulling from a deck of 60 cards numbered 1-60. Your
cards are put into fixed slots on your rack and once placed cannot be moved within the
rack. Each move a player can either pull the top card from the discard pile or a fresh
card from the deck. See more at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rack-O

The program I've written is single player Rack-O against an intelligent computer opponent.'''
